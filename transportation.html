	<h1>Taniti Tourism</h1>

	<h2>Transportation</h2>
	<p>Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. While the island has an area of less than 500 square miles,
		the terrain is varied and includes both sandy and rocky beaches, a small but safe harbor, lush tropical
		rainforests, and a mountainous interior that includes a small, active volcano. Taniti has an indigenous
		population of about 20,000. Until a recent increase in tourism, most the Tanitian economy was dominated by
		fishing or agriculture.
	</p>

	<h2>Ground Transportation</h2>
	<p>Public buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day. Private buses serve the rest of the
		island. Taxis are available in Taniti City, and rental cars can be rented from a local rental agency near the
		airport. Bikes and helmets are available to rent from several vendors (helmets are required by law). Taniti City
		is fairly flat and very walkable. Many tourists stay in the area surrounding Merriton Landing: this area is easy
		to explore on foot.
