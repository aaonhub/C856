	<h1>Taniti Tourism Site</h1>
	<p>Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. While the island has an area of less than 500 square miles,
		the terrain is varied and includes both sandy and rocky beaches, a small but safe harbor, lush tropical
		rainforests, and a mountainous interior that includes a small, active volcano. Taniti has an indigenous
		population of about 20,000. Until a recent increase in tourism, most the Tanitian economy was dominated by
		fishing or agriculture.
